## 🗂️ Project Structure

```

Thanks for the screenshot! The issue is that GitHub doesn't render inline trees properly unless they're inside a **code block** with triple backticks (\`\`\`) and consistent spacing.

Here’s the **correct and clean way** to display the project tree in your `README.md`, using a fenced code block:

---

### 📂 Project Structure
